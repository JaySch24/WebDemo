                        <ul>

                            <p>
                            Sow daisy seeds in the spring. Daisy seeds can be sown outside when the soil has hit 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            <p>
                            Plant the seeds in a sunny spot. Daisy seeds need light to germinate, and the flowers do best in full sun.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li>
                            <p>
                            Freely sow the daisy seeds. Cover the sowed seeds with an eighth of an inch of soil so that the sunlight can still reach the seeds.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                            Plant the seeds in nutrient-rich, well-draining soil. Use a mix of sand, peat moss, and manure compost soil for your daisies.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                            Keep the soil moist. Water the soil to keep it moist. The seeds should germinate in 10 to 20 days.
                            </p>

                <h2>Lilies</h2>

                    <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Plant your bulbs in spring or fall
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Loosen the soil to a depth of 12-15 inches. Deep planting is important as it will help stabilize your lily and potentially elminate the need for staking.
                        Mix in a 2-4 inch layer of compost. Dig a hold about 6 inches deep and set the lilies with the roots facing down.
                        Cover the lillies with a layer of soil, press down firmly and water throughly. Space your lily bulbs at a distance of 8-18 inches.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Lilies perform best in full sun or part shade. They need 6-8 hours of sun per day and like having 'cold feet'. Therefore, it is advisable to shade the lower
                        part of the plant, which will also protect the roots from drying out
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Most Lilies enjoy rich, acidic to neutral soils, but some are lime-tolerant or prefer alkaline soils.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>
                        Well-drained soils are critical. Good moisture is required and dry soils should be avoided!
                        </p>

                    <h2>Sunflowers</h2>
                    <img src="Images/sunflower.png" alt="Sunflower">
                        <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                            Sunflowers need full sun; see 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day – the more the better if you are trying to grow them to their maximum potential. so get a shamba where there is direct Sunlight and sheltered form wind.
                            Sunflowers thrive in warm to hot climates with full sunshine during the day. Dry seasons are perfect for growing sunflowers
                            Check Soil PH: Sunflowers prefer a slightly acidic to somewhat alkaline soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. even though they are  relatively resilient and can grow in most types of soil.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                            Choose a well-drained location, begin planting after the soil has completely warmed and the dry season has set in.
                            Prepare your soil by digging an area of about 2-3 feet in circumference to a depth of about 2 feet.
                            Sunflowers are heavy feeders and deplete the soil more than many other crops – especially if you are growing them to reach a massive height so the nutrient supply must be replenished each season.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>
                            Feed often and water regularly. While the plant is small, water around the root zone, about 3-4 in. from the plant with about 2 gallons of properly diluted liquid fertilizer solution per week. For larger plants, scrape out a small doughnut-shaped moat about 18 inches around the plant and about four inches deep. Pour several gallons of properly diluted fertilizer into the moat every week.  Sunflower roots can grow to 4 feet below the soil surface.
